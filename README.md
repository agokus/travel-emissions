# travel-emissions
This repository contains the data published in 'Astronomyâ€™s climate 
emissions: global travel to scientific meetings in 2019 by
Gokus et al. (2023) in PNAS Nexus.

Processed data files (output in form of .csv files from the 
'Travel Footprint calculator' by Didier Barret at https://travel-footprint-calculator.irap.omp.eu/)
for Astronomy conferences and schools in 2019 are provided in
the folder 'Calculated Emissions'.

A Jupyter notebook (Data\_processing\_conferences.ipynb) is available
to use for the data processing, analysing, and illustrating for a larger
amount of meetings - here, as an example, for all Astronomy conferences
that took place in the year 2019.
The notebook runs with Python 3 and the following packages need to have
been installed: numpy, pandas, and matplotlib.
